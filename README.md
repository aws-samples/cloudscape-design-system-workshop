# Workshop: Build a cloud experience with Cloudscape, an open-source design system

In this workshop, we will go from an empty React TypeScript project to building a basic application using Cloudscape components in three steps:

* Step 1: Create the basic layout used throughout the application.
* Step 2: Add a Table view.
* Step 3: Add a Creation flow.

All steps towards the final application are available as branches on the repository.

## Introduction

Created in 2016, Cloudscape is Amazon Web Services (AWS) open source design system for building intuitive, engaging, and inclusive user experiences at scale. Since then, the system has evolved—based on customer feedback and research—to consist of an extensive guidelines for web applications, design resources, and front-end components to streamline implementation. AWS teams use Cloudscape to improve the user experience and implement applications faster. These guidelines and component APIs can be found in the Components section of the [Cloudscape website](https://cloudscape.design/components/overview/).
